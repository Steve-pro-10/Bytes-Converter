# Bytes-Converter
This program in python is made for converting multiples of the binary byte.

It is better than google's because it calculates the multiples with power of 2 instead of power of 10.

To make the program work you must download the images.zip folder and unzip it, and move it in the same path as the program's.

If you find a bug or you want to optimize the code, don't hesitate to do a pull request!
