# Bytes-Converter
This program in python is made for converting multiples of the binary byte.
To use it you have to pip install the libraries "customtkinter", used to make the UI of the program and the library "pillow", used to display images in the program.
And don't forget to download and unzip the zip folder "images", that contains the images in the UI of the program and the icon of the program. The "images" folder MUST BE in the same path as the mbconverter.py file.
