# Bytes-Converter
This program in python is made for converting bytes to kilobytes, to mb, gb, terabytes and pentabytes.
To use it you have to pip install the libraries "customtkinter", used to make the UI of the program and the library "pillow", used to display images in the program.
And don't forget to download and unzip the zip folder "images", that contains the images in the UI of the program and the icon of the program. The "images" folder MUST BE in the same path as the mbconverter.py file.
